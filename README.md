## Setup

### Require module directly

In your `package.json` under the `jest` section add the `setupFiles` attribute with this module name.

```json
"jest": {
  "setupFiles": [
    "jest-localstorage-mock"
  ]
}
```

### Use setup file

Alternatively you can create a new setup file and require this module.

`__setups__/localstorage.js`
```js
global.chrome = require('jest-localstorage-mock');
```

And add that file to your `setupFiles`:

```json
"jest": {
  "setupFiles": [
    "./__setups__/localstorage.js"
  ]
}
```

### Use with create-react-app

In `src/setupTests.js` you can add this at the beginning:

```
require("jest-localstorage-mock");
```

## Usage

With this module setup in Jest you can run your web tests that rely on `localstorage` without fail.
